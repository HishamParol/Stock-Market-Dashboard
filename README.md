# Introduction
Cloud Computing which is based on internet is the on-demand delivery of IT resources and powerful computations on the basis of pay as you go scheme. In this project, I have given 
a brief of exploring different cloud services in two powerful giants – Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to development a web application. This service helps user to calculate Value at Risk, profit/loss and other parameters for four different companies. The outcome of this 
project is to understand and utilize on-demand cloud services and compare the costs of scalable resources.
