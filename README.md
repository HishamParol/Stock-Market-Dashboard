# Introduction
Cloud Computing which is based on internet is the on-demand delivery of IT resources and powerful computations on the basis of pay as you go scheme. In this project, I have given 
a brief of exploring different cloud services in two powerful giants – Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to development a web application. This service helps user to calculate Value at Risk, profit/loss and other parameters for four different companies. The outcome of this 
project is to understand and utilize on-demand cloud services and compare the costs of scalable resources.

The term ‘Cloud’ which means collection of networks in computing world is a distributed, on-demand and convenient service that has easy access to IT resources at a reasonable 
cost. According to NIST SP Cloud computing is characterized as a profound economic and technical shift which has a great potential to reduce the cost of IT systems .Instead of setting up one’s own infrastructure, which adds money, the users have to pay for the services they had used. In this experiment I have hosted my web application on Google Cloud Platform that provides Platform as a Service (PaaS) ,Amazon S3, which is a scalable storage infrastructure to store data and Amazon Lambda and EC2 resources for computation processes. ** This cloud system is compatible with the NIST’s service model – Software as a Service(SaaS), Platform as a Service( PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS).**
